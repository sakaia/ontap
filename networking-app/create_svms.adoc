You must create an SVM to serve data to clients.

*Before you begin*

* You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.
* You must know which security style the SVM root volume will have.
+
If you plan to implement a Hyper-V or SQL Server over SMB solution on this SVM, you should use NTFS security style for the root volume. Volumes that contain Hyper-V files or SQL database files must be set to NTFS security at the time they are created. By setting the root volume security style to NTFS, you ensure that you do not inadvertently create UNIX or mixed security-style data volumes.

*Steps*

. Determine which aggregates are candidates for containing the SVM root volume.
+
`storage aggregate show -has-mroot false`
+
You must choose an aggregate that has at least 1 GB of free space to contain the root volume. If you intend to configure NAS auditing on the SVM, you must have a minimum of 3 GB of extra free space on the root aggregate, with the extra space being used to create the auditing staging volume when auditing is enabled.
+
[NOTE]
If NAS auditing is already enabled on an existing SVM, the aggregate's staging volume is created immediately after aggregate creation is successfully completed.

. Record the name of the aggregate on which you want to create the SVM root volume.
. If you plan on specifying a language when you create the SVM and do not know the value to use, identify and record the value of the language you want to specify:
+
`vserver create -language ?`

. If you plan on specifying a Snapshot policy when you create the SVM and do not know the name of the policy, list the available policies and identify and record the name of the Snapshot policy you want to use:
+
`volume snapshot policy show -vserver <vserver_name>`

. If you plan on specifying a quota policy when you create the SVM and do not know the name of the policy, list the available policies and identify and record the name of the quota policy you want to use:
+
`volume quota policy show -vserver <vserver_name>`

. Create an SVM:
+
`vserver create -vserver <vserver_name> -aggregate <aggregate_name> ‑rootvolume <root_volume_name> -rootvolume-security-style {unix|ntfs|mixed} [-ipspace <IPspace_name>] [-language <language>] [-snapshot-policy <snapshot_policy_name>] [-quota-policy <quota_policy_name>] [-comment <comment>]`
+
`vserver create -vserver vs1 -aggregate aggr3 -rootvolume vs1_root ‑rootvolume-security ntfs -ipspace ipspace1 -language en_US.UTF-8`
+
`[Job 72] Job succeeded: Vserver creation completed`

. Verify that the SVM configuration is correct.
+
`vserver show -vserver vs1`
+

In this example, the command creates the SVM named "vs1" in IPspace "ipspace1". The root volume is named "vs1_root" and is created on aggr3 with NTFS security style.
